## ZooKeeper Overview

ZooKeeper is a centralized service designed for building distributed systems, providing essential functionalities for configuration management, synchronization, and group services. Here's an overview of its main goals:

### Configuration Management

ZooKeeper facilitates the storage and management of configuration information vital for distributed systems. It stores metadata, system configurations, and dynamic settings that need to be shared across multiple nodes.

### Naming Service

It offers a hierarchical namespace similar to a file system, enabling distributed applications to organize and name resources consistently and reliably.

### Distributed Synchronization

ZooKeeper provides primitives like locks, barriers, and semaphores that enable distributed applications to coordinate and synchronize their activities across multiple nodes.

### Group Services

It allows the creation of dynamic groups or memberships among distributed nodes, enabling them to share information and collaborate effectively.

### High Availability

ZooKeeper is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It achieves this through data replication across multiple servers, ensuring operational continuity even if some servers fail.

ZooKeeper plays a vital role in the development of distributed systems by providing a reliable and efficient coordination service, simplifying the task of building scalable and resilient distributed applications.
