Thank you for clarifying the location where you found the Debian distribution is missing. It seems that you've identified that the Debian distribution is not listed under "Manage Targets" in the IntelliJ IDEA "Edit Configurations" dialog.

To resolve this issue and ensure that the Debian distribution is listed as a target in IntelliJ IDEA for managing configurations:

### Configure WSL Distribution Paths in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and navigate to "File" > "Settings" (or "IntelliJ IDEA" > "Preferences" on macOS).
2. In the Settings/Preferences dialog, go to "Build, Execution, Deployment" > "WSL".
3. Ensure that both the Ubuntu and Debian distributions are correctly configured and listed in the "Manage Targets" section.

### Add Debian Distribution if Missing:

- If the Debian distribution is not listed under "Manage Targets", you can add it manually by clicking the "+" button and selecting the Debian distribution from the list of available distributions.

### Verify Configuration:

- After adding the Debian distribution, verify that it appears in the list under "Manage Targets".

### Update/Edit Configurations:

- Once the Debian distribution is listed as a target, you should be able to select it when creating or editing run/debug configurations, such as for building and running your project.

By ensuring that the Debian distribution is correctly configured and listed as a target in IntelliJ IDEA's WSL settings, you should be able to access it when managing configurations for your projects.
